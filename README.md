# Storipress Issue Tracker
This is where we keep track of all bugs and feature requests for [Storipress](https://storipress.com/).

Please note the issue tracker is not for technical support questions.

If you have questions about things like SEO Optimisation, tweaking a design in a particular way, accomplishing some interactive behavior with JavaScript, etc., we recommend joining the Storipress Slack community and asking your question to the group:

[*Join the Tailwind UI Discord Community*](https://storipresscommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-x9n0sw92-Ps4Bb5e8DB4YvohfVS_Caw#/shared-invite/email)

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, we do not offer technical support or consulting. We do monitor the Storipress community closely and will happily chime in with answers or advice if we see a question we are able to help with (we're friendly Aussies, you should see how much time we spend helping people for free already), we just can't guarantee official technical support as part of your purchase.
